# Landmark-Recognition-Challenge

This Repository contains code files for our M.Sc. Computer Science Major Project.
The Project involves participating in the Google Landmark Recognition Challenge Hosted on Kaggle.

All the code is written in python language. We ran our code on Goole Colaboratory Cloud Service for Deep Learning.

1. First run the Filtered Data.ipynb
2. Then run Landmark Recognition.ipynb

Note: Since the code is written according to the Google Colab Virtual Machine, we used Google drive and Server space for our Dataset files. So you may have to modify file paths to run it properly.
